Managing Dependencies

Getting access to behaviour when that behavior is implemented in other objects.

"Because well designed ojects have a single responsibility, their very natue requires that they collaborate to accomplish complex tasks."
-to collaborate, an object must know something about others
-Knowing creates a dependancy
-dependencies can strangle an aplication if not managed carefully

"An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might be forced to change in turn", i.e. the objects are tightly coupled.
