Single Responsibility Principle

Every module, class or function should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly allignedwith that responsibility.
"A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." - Robert C. Martin

Depend on Behaviour, not Data
-encapsulate data with an accessor. Behavior live in one and only one (OAOO) place, don't repeat yourself (DRY) and single source of truth (SSOT).


"Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons."
-increase cohesion between things that change for the same reason, and decrease the coupling of those things that change for different reasons.

"However, as you think about this principle, remember that the reason for change are people. It is people who request changes...."


Summary: (from Chapter 2)
The path t ochangable and maintainable OO software begins with classes that have a single responsibilty. Classes that do one thing isolate that thing from the rest of your application. This isolation allows change without consequence and reuse without duplication.
